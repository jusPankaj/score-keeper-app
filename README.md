# score-keeper-app
It is a Scorekeeper web application that has been made using HTML, CSS, JS, and the famous Front End Library ReactJS. 
I made it while learning ReactJs so  we have basic features and an understanding of React. Which we can see in the project.
It has the following features :
  1. We can see the ball-by-ball scores and It also adds up to the total score and wicket.
  2. We can add some comments after every ball which will show in commentary.
  3. We have added . instead of zero run and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 accordingly.
